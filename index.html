          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Shrunked is an extension that resizes your photos before you upload them to a website or email them. It greatly reduces the time spent waiting for photos to upload.</p>
          <p>You can get Shrunked from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/shrunked-image-resizer?src=external-github">addons.mozilla.org</a>. If you got it from somewhere else, including my own website, it's not genuine. Visit a.m.o. and get a fresh copy.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/shrunked/3.2-options.png" width="485" height="405" alt="Shrunked Image Resizer dialog in version 3.2" /></p>
        </section><section id="main_right">
          <h3>Localization</h3>
          <p>You might be here because you'd like to see Shrunked in your language. Great!</p>
          <p>To translate, you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fork the Git repository, translate, and send me a pull request. Some knowledge of creating Mozilla add-ons is required.</li>
            <li>Or, visit <a href="http://zoo.darktrojan.net/darktrojan/shrunked/repo.php">the project's page on Zoo</a>, a website for add-on translation. (Please note that Zoo is under development, and could break at any time. It's mostly stable though.)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Contribute code</h3>
          <p>Want to add some functionality to Shrunked? Feel free to send me a pull request.</p>
          <p>To get a working version of this repo in your Firefox profile, clone it into your extensions directory as <code>shrunked@darktrojan.net</code> and start Firefox.</p>

          <h3>Contribute money</h3>
          <p>Add-ons are available for free, but developing and supporting them does take a considerable amount of time. Please consider making a donation to help me pay my bills. You can contribute any amount you like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/shrunked-image-resizer/contribute/installed/">through PayPal via addons.mozilla.org</a>. (Note though that for amounts smaller than about US$1, PayPal takes most of it.)</p>
